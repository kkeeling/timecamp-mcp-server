# Key Decisions

* Decided to enable direct GitHub installation of the TimeCamp MCP server using modern Python packaging: add `pyproject.toml`, define `console_scripts` entry point, update project structure and README; support installation via `pipx` and `uv`/`uvx`.

# Recent Work

* July 14, 2025 – Updated README to prioritize direct GitHub installation instructions for the TimeCamp MCP server: moved client configuration to the top, added `uvx timecamp-mcp-server` primary example, alternative `uv tool run --from git+...` usage, VS Code configuration examples, updated prerequisites (uv/pipx), fixed `~/.claude/claude_desktop_config.json` path, and moved manual installation to a separate section.
* July 13, 2025 – Finalized packaging changes: committed restructuring, `pyproject.toml`, CLI entry point, updated documentation, and fixed test imports. Verified installation via `pipx`, `uv tool`, and `pip` from GitHub; all 40 tests passing.
* July 12, 2025 – Completed packaging and GitHub install support: created `pyproject.toml` with console_scripts, restructured into `src/timecamp_mcp_server`, added `cli.py`/`__main__.py`, moved and refactored modules, updated imports and tests, refreshed README, verified installation via `pipx`/`uv`/`pip`, CLI and module execution, all 30 tests passing.
* July 10, 2025 – Reached consensus on plan to package TimeCamp MCP server for direct GitHub installation; defined required `pyproject.toml` configuration, entry point, project structure updates, and identified three example repositories.
* July 7, 2025 – Completed Phase 4: Enhanced MCP Features (implemented prompt templates, enhanced caching with ETag support, added state change tracking and search functionality; all 30 tests passing)

# Next Steps

* Test installation workflows against identified example patterns (disler/aider-mcp-server, evalstate/mcp-py-repl, vectara/vectara-mcp)  
* Deploy to production environment  
* Monitor performance metrics with the new caching system  
* Consider implementing more robust ETag generation with JSON serialization  
* Add comprehensive logging throughout the application  
* Create deployment documentation and Docker configuration  
* Set up monitoring and alerting for the MCP server
